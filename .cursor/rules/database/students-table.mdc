**Description:** This rule defines the structure, fields, and relationships of the `students` table, which links each student to their school, program, and term in LIA Banken.

```
# Students Table Definition

## Purpose
Represents student-specific data and links the student to their program and school.

## Fields
- `id`: UUID (PK)
- `user_id`: UUID (FK to auth.users)
- `school_id`: UUID (FK to schools)
- `program_id`: UUID (FK to education_programs)
- `term_id`: UUID (FK to education_terms)
- `phone`: string
- `city`: string
- `status`: enum (e.g. "looking", "placed")
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `updated_at`: timestamp

## Behavior
- `user_id` must be linked to a valid Supabase auth user.
- Email domain must match the associated school domain.
- Only one student record per user.

## Security
- RLS: Students can only access and update their own records.
- Schools can view students linked to their school.
