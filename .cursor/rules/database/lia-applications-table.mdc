**Description:** This rule defines the structure, status lifecycle, and behavior of the `lia_applications` table in LIA Banken, which tracks internship applications submitted by students to employers.

```
# LIA Applications Table Definition

## Purpose
Links students to LIA posts, representing the application and its current status.

## Fields
- `id`: UUID (PK)
- `student_id`: UUID (FK to students)
- `lia_post_id`: UUID (FK to lia_posts)
- `status`: enum (e.g. "sent", "interview", "accepted", "rejected")
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `updated_at`: timestamp

## Behavior
- A student can apply to multiple LIA posts.
- Only one application can be marked as "accepted" per student per LIA term.
- Employers can update status based on review actions: Reject, Interview, Accept.
- Students can view their application status from their dashboard.

## Security
- Students can only see their own applications.
- Employers can only access applications linked to their own LIA posts.
- RLS must enforce both ownership and visibility constraints.
