**Description:** This rule defines the structure of education-related tables (`education_programs`, `education_terms`, and `program_categories`) in LIA Banken and how they relate to schools and students.

```
# Program Structure Tables

## education_programs
- Represents each unique educational track created by a school.
- Fields:
  - `id`: UUID (PK)
  - `school_id`: FK to schools
  - `name`: string
  - `code`: string (e.g., program code)
  - `category_id`: FK to program_categories
  - `description`: text
  - `website`: URL
  - `studietakt`: enum (e.g. 100%, 75%, 50%)
  - `studieform`: enum (e.g. plats, distance, flex)
  - `city`, `country`: string
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`

## education_terms
- Represents specific periods (e.g., 2023–2025) within a program.
- Fields:
  - `id`: UUID (PK)
  - `program_id`: FK to education_programs
  - `label`: string (e.g. "2023–2025")
  - `start_date`, `end_date`: date
  - `student_capacity`: int
  - `archived`: boolean

## program_categories
- Central list managed by superadmin.
- Fields:
  - `id`: UUID (PK)
  - `name`: string (e.g. IT, Healthcare, Economics)

## Relationships
- Programs belong to a school.
- Terms belong to a program.
- Students are linked to a program and a term during registration.
- Category values are selected from a centralized admin-controlled list.

## Security
- Schools can only manage their own programs and terms.
- Students can only select from active programs/terms during registration.
