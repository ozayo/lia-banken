**Description:** This rule set guides the AI in adhering to Next.js best practices, file conventions, and common patterns for modular and scalable applications.

```
# Next.js Conventions

- App Router (not Pages Router) is used across the project.
- Each main route uses its own `layout.tsx` to encapsulate its UI logic.
- Pages follow folder-based routing: e.g. `/dashboard/student/profile/page.tsx`.
- Server Components are preferred by default. Use Client Components only when needed (e.g., stateful logic, interactivity).
- Route folders are lowercase and kebab-case (e.g., `lia-students`, `lia-plats`).
- Components use PascalCase for filenames (e.g., `StudentCard.tsx`).
- UI state (e.g. modal open/close) is handled locally via `useState` or `useContext` â€” no global state lib is used.
