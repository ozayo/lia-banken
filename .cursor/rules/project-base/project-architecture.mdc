**Description:** This rule defines the modular architecture of the LIA Banken project, including route structure, dashboard isolation, and file organization patterns to ensure scalability and separation of concerns.

```
# Project Architecture Guidelines

## Routing & Folders
- Public-facing pages (home, login, registry, student list, LIA ads) live under `/app/`.
- All user dashboards are located under `/dashboard/` directory to avoid conflict with the Next.js App Router system.
- Route segments are organized per role: `/dashboard/student`, `/dashboard/school`, `/dashboard/foretag`, `/dashboard/admin`

## Layout & Structure
- Each dashboard has its own `layout.tsx`, route-specific components, and internal pages.
- All dashboards are developed as isolated modules. Errors in one dashboard must not affect others.

## Shared UI
- Common UI components (buttons, inputs, modals) live in `/components/ui`
- Role-specific components (cards, dashboard widgets) live in `/components/student`, `/components/school`, etc.

## Language & Naming
- UI will be presented in Swedish.
- All code, variable names, and database schema will be in English.
