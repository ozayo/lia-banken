**Description:** This rule defines how form components should be implemented using shadcn/ui, react-hook-form, and zod within the LIA Banken project.

```
# Form Components Guidelines

## Technologies
- Use `react-hook-form` to manage form state.
- Use `zod` for schema-based validation.
- UI elements must be built with shadcn/ui components: `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `Button`, `Label`, etc.

## Structure
- Each form component should be modular and reusable.
- Validation errors must be shown inline below the respective field.
- Submit buttons must indicate loading state.
- Optional fields should be clearly labeled.

## Layout
- Use TailwindCSS for spacing and layout.
- Align labels and inputs using flex or grid where needed.
- Forms should be responsive on mobile and desktop.

## Accessibility
- Use proper `aria-*` attributes for accessibility.
- Label elements must be properly associated with inputs via `htmlFor` and `id`.

## UX
- Display toast notifications or feedback on success/error using a consistent method (e.g. shadcn/toast).
- Form submission should be disabled until all required fields are valid.
