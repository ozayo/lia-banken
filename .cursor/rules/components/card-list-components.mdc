**Description:** This rule provides standards for building reusable list and card UI components that display dynamic data like students, LIA postings, or applications.

```
# Card & List Components Guidelines

## Purpose
- Used to render search results, recent items, listings, and summarized records.

## Common Elements
- Each card should include a title, metadata (e.g. dates, status), short description, and optional actions.
- Use shadcn/ui components: `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `Badge`, `Button`, etc.

## Layout
- Use responsive grid or flexbox layouts.
- Support list or grid display toggle (if applicable).

## Interactivity
- Cards may contain buttons or links for actions like Edit, View, Apply, Invite.
- Clicking a card can navigate to a detail page or open a modal.

## Reusability
- Make card components role-agnostic where possible (e.g. `<StudentCard>`, `<LiaPostCard>`).
- Accept props like `data`, `onClick`, and `variant` for styling.
