**Description:** This rule defines how navigation components such as sidebars, top navs, and breadcrumbs should be structured and styled for the LIA Banken dashboards.

```
# Navigation Components Guidelines

## Structure
- Each dashboard should include its own sidebar navigation.
- Use a vertical sidebar layout with Tailwind + shadcn/ui primitives.
- Include clear links to: Home, Account, Profile, Applications, etc. (based on role).
- Use icons (e.g. lucide-react) next to nav links where applicable.

## Shared Behaviors
- Active route highlighting must be supported (e.g. based on pathname).
- Logout button should be included in every nav.
- Top navbar can be optional; if used, include user avatar/menu and context info.

## Reusability
- Define generic `SidebarNav` and `NavItem` components to be reused per role.
- Dashboard-specific navs live under: `/components/student/SidebarNav.tsx`, etc.

## Accessibility
- Use `nav` and `aria-label` tags appropriately.
- All links must be keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.
