**Description:** This rule outlines the layout, key sections, and functionalities available in the student dashboard module of LIA Banken.

# Student Dashboard Guidelines

## Location
- The student dashboard is located at `/dashboard/student`

## Sections
1. **Dashboard Home**
   - Initially empty, designed for future widgets and statistics.

2. **My Account**
   - Displays student's name, school, program, term, internship start/end date.
   - Allows editing of name, phone number, and city.

3. **My LIA Profile**
   - Allows creation/editing of cover letter, CV (PDF), external links, and target position.
   - Includes save and publish actions.

4. **Application Status**
   - Lists applications made by the student with status tags: Sent, Rejected, In Process, Accepted.
   - Lists received employer invitations, interview requests, and direct offers.
   - Offers "Confirm Placement" button for accepted offers.

## Behavior
- Students can only have one active accepted placement per LIA period.
- Status changes (e.g. Confirmed Placement) must reflect across school and employer dashboards.
