   - School description (text area)
   - School website
   - Student email domain configuration

3. **Education Programs**
   - List, add, edit, delete education programs.
   - Fields: name, code, category (admin-managed), description, website, pace, form, city, country

4. **LIA Periods**
   - List active and archived LIA terms
   - Add new LIA:
     - Select program
     - Enter term (e.g. 2023â€“2025)
     - Add start/end dates and total student count
